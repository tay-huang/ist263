        <p> 
            My name is Taylor Huang. I am dual majoring in Information Management and Technology and Magazine Journalism. I am really interested in making technology more digestible through writing and data analytics and helping equip others with tools in this ever-changing digital world. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This past summer, I interned on the <strong>Source to Pay Team at Twitter, Inc.</strong>, where I learned a bit of JavaScript and worked on projects to automate and enhance the teamâ€™s internal processes. I also am a freelance news writer at Mashed.com, an online food publication, and am really interested in bringing my growing web development skills to this field.

        <h2>Personal Info</h2>
        <p>
            Outside of work and school, I love staying active and going on hikes, doing yoga, and trying different workout classes. I am also a huge foodie and love exploring the food scene when traveling to different cities. I have one younger sister, who I am very close to because we are only a year apart.
